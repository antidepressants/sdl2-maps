First project using graphics, unoptimized and dirty code to visualize raster ascii grids (elevation) from opentopography
and vector maps (urban) from openstreetmap. Supposed to be used later for a wargame project. Don't worry too much about
the 'game' part, implementation mostly copied from tutorial online.
